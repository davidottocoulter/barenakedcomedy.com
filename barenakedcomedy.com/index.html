                    <p>The ORIGINAL. Often copied, never duplicated. Barenaked Comedy&rsquo;s show at The Pinch started with a year of sold-out shows and didn&rsquo;t stop there. It&rsquo;s our home to experiment and try new show formats, nearly every month, on top of our tried and true &ldquo;Barenaked Comedy&rdquo; formula of 
awesomeness, book-ended by tits.</p>

                    <p>The co-founder of Barenaked Comedy, Mindi Mimosa has been popping corks throughout DC since October 2012. Sassy, cheeky, and a little bit boozy, Mindi&rsquo;s quick wit and flirtatious stylings always take center-stage and command audience attention. This rowdy dame has an affinity for laughter, smut, and bourbon. Her burlesque stylings leave you laughing and hopefully a little sexually confused. When she is not producing a kickass show for Barenaked Comedy, she can be seen performing at and hosting burlesque shows around the city. If you are interested in booking her, please send an email to: <a href="mailto:mindi@barenakedcomedy.com?subject=Booking for a show">mindi@barenakedcomedy.com</a>

                    <p>The significantly less naked co-founder of Barenaked Comedy, David Coulter is a stand-up comic who's been doing that for a couple of years now. He likes crude, thoughtful humor, and the rowdy, participative crowds that burlesque shows tend to bring. You can catch David at shows all over DC, or angrily muttering in the streets on the way to another show. Want him to host or perform at your event?

                    <h4>Once upon a time...</h4>
                    <p>after an open mic stand-up comedy show, in the basement of a DC bar, Mindi Mimosa and David Coulter met. It was on this evening that these two sexy and hilarious masterminds melded together in like-minded absurdity. &ldquo;The bar arts don&rsquo;t exist together! There are so many different scenes! Why on earth aren&rsquo;t the variety arts more connected?!&rdquo;, they raved. They agreed that DC needed a way to reconnect with the roots of the variety arts while staying contemporary and relevant. Burlesque and Stand-up started together in vaudeville and they should be together again, Goddammit.</p>
                    <p>Thus, Barenaked Comedy was conceived.</p>
                    <p>Merely two months later, the owner of local watering hole, The Pinch, contacted Mindi. They needed a burlesque show, and stat! &ldquo;How about a stand-up comedy/burlesque show?&rdquo;, Mindi suggested. The owner agreed, this sounded fabulous. The show was a glittery sensation and it was decreed, Barenaked Comedy shall present comedy and burlesque to the citizens of DC at The Pinch on the 4th Friday of every month henceforth.</p>
                    <p>After over a year of amazing, monthly (sold out) shows, Barenaked Comedy is excited to be DC&rsquo;s premiere burlesque/stand-up comedy show. We book the best of the local talent available. We have had the opportunity to have guests visit from as far away as California and Quebec. We are looking forward for many more!

                    <p>We are excited to announce that we have been selected to produce Barenaked Comedy at the 2015 Capital Fringe Festival!</p>
                    <p>To help us make this dream a reality, we will shamelessly launch an Indiegogo Campaign. Every little bit helps and we have exciting and sexy perks for donating to the campaign. We'll be updating this soon to show how you could contribute to helping bring (partial)nudity and laughter to this year&rsquo;s Capital Fringe Festival!

                    <p>Mindi and David believe that Barenaked Comedy has the ability to be more than an amazing, once monthly spectacle of laughter and (partial)nudity. This potent pair is determined to create supportive, safe, and professional environments where the variety arts can thrive. Barenaked Comedy is currently in the process of filing to become a 501(c)3 non-profit arts organization. In the future, we plan to provide financial sponsorship to individual artists, while continuing to produce our own productions. We also intend to continue to increase the quality of our shows and help make high-quality, variety performances achievable and accessible.</p>
